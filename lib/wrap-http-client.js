 * Wraps the http client with a rate limiter, and a backoff functionality.

 * limit from ever being hit.
 * The backoff is triggered if a 429 Too Many Requests error is received from
 * the server, and every time if it is received repeateadly the wait time
 * for the next try will increase exponentially.

 * @param {Object} http - HTTP Client instances
 * @param {Object} options - Options for the wrapper methods
 * @prop {number} concurrency - Number of allowed concurrent requests
 * @prop {number} delay - Delay in milliseconds for waiting after hitting the
 * allowed number of concurrent requests
 * @prop {number} maxRetries - Maximum number of retries when a 429 is received
 * @prop {boolean} retryOnTooManyRequests - If we should retry on 429s
